# OpenGL with C++
## Intro and setup
### :hammer: Preface
OpenGl is a state machine between the user and the graphics card to aid in graphics programming.
There is a lot of different GPU programming startpoints, but **OpenGL** is (apparently) the best
tool to learn about it.

At first, a lot of the programming will be done inside a single file but starting from advanced lessons, we'll integrate MVC into our project :sparkles:. And the end goal is to have a small-scope *(but playable !)* little game.

### :triangular_ruler: Creating the project folder
We'll need two folders
+ `src`
    - [I] All of our source code files will be placed into this folder.
+ `dependencies`
    - [I] For our project to work, we will need to use the GLFW library. In my case, installing it is just a matter of pulling the glfw package from the arch package repository.
